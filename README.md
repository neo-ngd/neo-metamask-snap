# Neo Snap

This Snap allows MetaMask users to interact with the Neo blockchain.

## Usage

Since this is a beta version, you need [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/). You cannot have other versions of MetaMask installed. For apps to be able to connect to Flask, you will need to disable MetaMask and any other wallets that might be overriding the `window.ethereum` object.

The Snap can be installed by visiting [https://vitalwallet.xyz/](https://vitalwallet.xyz/).
